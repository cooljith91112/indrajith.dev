<p class="article-intro indent-8">
    People always think game development is an expensive thing, because most of 
    the time when we search about game development we will discouraged by either 
    the subscription amount or the percentage cut of the so called AAA engines. 
    Yes you can makes games with those tools nobody is going to stop you, but the thing is by using
    open source tools and engines you are not bound to restrictive tools, you can adapt, modify and even
    introduce your own functionality in the tools/engine you are using.
